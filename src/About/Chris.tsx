        <p>Chris first started climbing in the Italian Alps. Since moving to Malta, he has become a central part of the local climbing community.</p>

<p>As part of the MCC committee for 3 years, he has welcomed many new climbers to the Maltese limestone. He knows every crag on the island and probably the amount of bolts on every route too.</p>
        
        <p>Now, as a co-owner of Ä ebla and true gear guru, Chris hopes to share his knowledge of climbing safety and techniques to foster a succesful next generation of climbers venturing outdoors.</p>
