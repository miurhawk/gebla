        <p>Carly is originally from the UK but is now settled in Malta, happy on the rocks or in the sea!</p>
        <p>She first tried climbing a decade ago, starting out as an indoor boulderer in a London gym and turning to sport climbing when she arrived in Malta, four years ago. </p>

<p>When she's not busy climbing or focused on Gebla, she's a freelance brand strategy consultant and <a href="https://brndwgn.com/" target="_blank">BRND WGN</a> associate.</p>

        <p>As co-owner of Ä ebla, Carly is passionate about giving people the opportunity to try climbing, creating a community and sharing her love for the outdoors.</p>
