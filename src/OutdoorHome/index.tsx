            <p>These beautiful Islands are blessed with easy access to stunning crags and hundreds of routes, often with incredible sea views.  </p>
            <p>Thanks to its small size, you never have to travel far to reach the crag and you’ll usually be just a quick jaunt from a beach for swimming afterwards.</p>
            <p>Maltese rock is limestone, with everything from epic overhanging lines in ancient caves to sketchy slabs. And most crags have a range of difficulties to suit climbers of all levels.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the friendliness of the people, a great restaurant and bar scene, an incredible cultural heritage and relentless clear blue sky, Malta is a wonderful place for your next climbing trip. </p>
            <p> And our <a href="/outdoor-home#guiding">guides</a> are here to save you time finding the crags and make sure you get the very most out of your trip.</p>
